/**
 * Interface used to indicate that this object represents a sharding key. A
 * {@code ShardingKey} instance is only guaranteed to be compatible with the
 * data source instance that it was derived from. A {@code ShardingKey} is
 * created using {@link Builder}.
 * <p>
 * The following example illustrates the use of {@link Builder} to create a
 * {@code ShardingKey}:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *
 *     DataSource ds = new MyDataSource();
 *     ShardingKey shardingKey = ds.createShardingKeyBuilder()
 *                           .subkey("abc", JDBCType.VARCHAR)
 *                           .subkey(94002, JDBCType.INTEGER)
 *                           .build();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 *
 * A {@code ShardingKey} is used for specifying a
 * {@link AdbaSessionProperty#SHARDING_KEY} or a
 * {@link AdbaSessionProperty#SHARDING_GROUP_KEY}. Databases that support
 * composite sharding may use a * to specify a additional level of partitioning
 * within to specify a additional level of partitioning within the shard.
 * <p>
 * The following example illustrates the use of {@link Builder} to create a
 * {@link AdbaSessionProperty#SHARDING_GROUP_KEY} for an eastern region with
 * a {@link AdbaSessionProperty#SHARDING_KEY} specified for the Pittsburgh
 * branch office:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *
 *     DataSource ds = new MyDataSource();
 *     ShardingKey superShardingKey = ds.shardingKeyBuilder()
 *                           .subkey("EASTERN_REGION", AdbaType.VARCHAR)
 *                           .build();
 *     ShardingKey shardingKey = ds.shardingKeyBuilder()
 *                           .subkey("PITTSBURGH_BRANCH", AdbaType.VARCHAR)
 *                           .build();
 *     Session con = ds.builder()
 *                           .property(SHARDING_GROUP_KEY, superShardingKey)
 *                           .property(SHARDING_KEY, shardingKey)
