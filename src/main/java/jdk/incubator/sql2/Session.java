/**
 * A {@code Session} is an abstraction of a SQL database and a group of
 * {@link Operation}s to be executed by that SQL database. No method on
 * {@code Session} or any of its dependent objects ({@link RowOperation} etc)
 * blocks. Any method that might block must execute any potentially blocking
 * action in a thread other than the calling thread.
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code Session} is independent of any particular data source. Any data
 * source that meets the specifications set by the {@link Builder} can
 * be used to execute the {@link Operation}s submitted to the {@code Session}.
 * An application is expected to create, use, and close {@code Session}s as
 * needed. An application should hold a {@code Session} only when required by
 * data source semantics. An implementation should cache and reused data source
 * resources as appropriate. {@code Session}s should not be cached.
 *
 * <p>
 * An implementation of this type must be thread safe as result and error
 * handlers running asynchronously may be accessing a {@code Session} in
 * parallel with each other and with a user thread. {@code Session}s are not
 * required to support multiplexed use; a single {@code Session} should be used
 * for only one unit of work at a time. Executing independent units of work on a
 * single {@code Session} in parallel will most likely lead to unpredictable
 * outcomes. As a rule of thumb only one user thread should access a
 * {@code Session} at a time. Such a user thread should execute a complete unit
 * of work before another user thread accesses the {@code Session}. An
 * implementation may support parallel multiplexed use, but it is not
 * required.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All methods inherited from {@link OperationGroup} throw
 * {@link IllegalStateException} if the the {@code Session} is closed.</p>
