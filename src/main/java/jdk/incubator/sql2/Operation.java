/**
 * A description of some work to be done by the database and how to process the
 * database output. An {@code Operation} is created by an
 * {@link OperationGroup}, configured and submitted. If not submitted it is not
 * executed. If submitted it is possibly executed according to the attributes of
 * the {@link OperationGroup} that created it.
 *
 * <p>
 * If execution of the work results in an error, the {@code Operation} is
 * completed exceptionally. The {@link Throwable} that completes the
 * {@code Operation} is implementation dependent. It is recommended that an
 * implementation use {@link SqlException} in the event of database problems.
 * Other {@link Throwable}s such as
 * {@link java.io.IOException}, {@link NullPointerException}, etc can be used as
 * appropriate. An implementation should not wrap a useful exception in a
 * {@link SqlException} unless that provides valuable additional information. An
 * implementation should use whatever {@link Throwable} best facilitates
 * appropriate error handling.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An {@code Operation} is not required to be thread safe. In general a single
 * user thread will configure and submit an Operation. Once an {@code Operation}
 * is submitted it is immutable. {@link OperationGroup} is an exception and is
 * thread safe.</p>
