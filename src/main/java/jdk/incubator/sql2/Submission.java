 * The result of submitting an {@link Operation}. The {@link cancel} method of a

 * that cancel attempts to cancel the database action? Conceptually this is fine.
 * The concern is that it requires the implementor to implement their own
 * CompletionStage or at the least subclass CompletableFuture to override
 * cancel. Neither of these is trivial.
