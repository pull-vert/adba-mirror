/**
 * <p>
 * A set of {@link Operation}s that share certain properties, are managed as a
 * unit, and are executed as a unit. The {@link Operation}s created by an
 * {@code OperationGroup} and submitted are the member {@link Operation}s of
 * that {@code OperationGroup}. An {@code OperationGroup} is not a transaction
 * and is not related to a transaction in any way.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An {@link OperationGroup} provides conditional execution, control of error
 * response, and control of execution order.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Execution of one or more {@link Operation}s may depend on the result of a
 * previous {@link Operation}. Depending on the result of that previous
 * {@link Operation} some other {@link Operation}s perhaps should not be
 * executed. For example consider an account withdrawal. If the amount to
 * withdraw exceeds the account balance the withdrawal {@link Operation}s should
 * not be executed and an overdraft {@link Operation} should be executed
 * instead. It would be possible for the user thread to wait for the balance
 * check {@link Operation} but that would block. Better would be to use the
 * {@link CompletionStage} of the balance check
 * {@link Operation} and submit the appropriate {@link Operation} in a
 * subsequent stage. But this is a common pattern and it is better still to
 * encapsulate that pattern, which conditional {@link OperationGroup} does.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Not all {@link Operation}s need to be executed in the order submitted. The
 * most common example is a mass insert. The order in which the records are
 * inserted doesn’t matter. A parallel {@link OperationGroup} gives the
 * implementation the freedom to execute the {@link Operation}s in any order. If
 * some of the {@link Operation}s have
 * {@link CompletionStage} parameters this can be
 * especially valuable.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link OperationGroup} also allows control of error response. By default if
 * one {@link Operation} fails all subsequent {@link Operation}s are skipped.
 * That’s not always right. Consider the mass insert case. Just because one
 * insert fails doesn’t mean they should all fail. An independent
 * {@link OperationGroup} does this; the failure of one {@link Operation} has no
 * impact on the execution of the rest.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As an {@link OperationGroup} is an {@link Operation} it must be submitted
 * before its member {@link Operation}s are executed. Submitting an {@link OperationGroup}
 * allows its member {@link Operation}s to be executed but does not prohibit more
 * member {@link Operation}s from being submitted. Member {@link Operation}s may be 
 * submitted before and after the containing {@link OperationGroup} is submitted.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The result of an {@link OperationGroup} depends on the results of its member
 * {@link Operation}s. Therefore an {@link OperationGroup} must know when all
 * member {@link Operation}s have been submitted. It cannot generate a
 * result until all member {@link Operation}s are completed. Since member {@link Operation}s can be
 * submitted after the {@link OperationGroup} has been submitted (see previous
 * paragraph) submitting the containing {@link OperationGroup} is not sufficient to mark that all member
 * {@link Operation}s have been submitted. Calling {@link OperationGroup#close} signals
 * that all member Operations have been submitted. After close is called, no
 * more member Operations may be submitted and the OperationGroup will complete 
 * when all member Operations are complete.</p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An {@code OperationGroup} conceptually has a collection of member
 * {@link Operation}s. When an {@code OperationGroup} is submitted it is placed
 * in the collection of the {@code OperationGroup} of which it is a member. The
 * member {@code OperationGroup} is executed according to the attributes of the
 * {@code OperationGroup} of which it is a member. The member {@link Operation}s
 * of an {@code OperationGroup} are executed according to the attributes of that
 * {@code OperationGroup}.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * How an {@code OperationGroup} is executed depends on its attributes.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If an {@code OperationGroup} has a condition and the value of that condition
 * is {@link Boolean#TRUE} then execute the member {@link Operation}s as below.
 * If it is {@link Boolean#FALSE} then the {@code OperationGroup} is completed
 * with the value null. If the condition completed exceptionally then the
 * {@code OperationGroup} is completed exceptionally with a
 * {@link SqlSkippedException} that has that exception as its cause.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the {@code OperationGroup} is sequential the member {@link Operation}s are
 * executed in the order they were submitted. If it is parallel, they may be
 * executed in any order including simultaneously.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If an {@code OperationGroup} is dependent and a member {@link Operation}
 * completes exceptionally the remaining member {@link Operation}s in the
 * collection are completed exceptionally with a {@link SqlSkippedException}
 * that has the initial {@link Exception} as its cause and the
 * {@code OperationGroup} is completed exceptionally with the initial
 * {@link Exception}. A member {@link Operation} in-flight may either complete
 * normally or be completed exceptionally but must complete one way or the
 * other. [NOTE: Too strong?]</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The result of this {@code OperationGroup} is the result of collecting the
 * results of its member {@link Operation}s. If the {@code OperationGroup} is
 * dependent and one of its member {@link Operation}s completes exceptionally,
 * the {@code OperationGroup} is completed exceptionally.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An implementation of this class must be thread safe as result and error
 * handlers running asynchronously may be accessing an {@code OperationGroup} in
 * parallel with each other and with a user thread.</p>
 *
* <p>
 * ISSUE: Currently no way to create a nested {@code OperationGroup}. That is an
 * intentional limitation but may be a simplification we can live with. Or
 * not.</p>
 *
 * @param <S> The type of the result of the member {@link Operation}s
